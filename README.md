Developed and cross-compiled using GCCSDK (instructions on how to setup here: https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/build-tools/environment) on Linux for RISC OS 5.

This project and others on my GitHub are example code for a guy who is learning C/C++ with the help of AI and the internet to write software for a very niche OS for fun.
